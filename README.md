# react-bio-v2
My link-in-bio website made in React. It currently does not use the full capabilities of React, but as I learn more things, I will update it so that it is less static and more reactive (see what I did there).

The frontend of the website uses tailwindcss to its maximum, hence there is very little use of custom css.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
